    These optimizations can help make the CART regressor more efficient and 
    robust, especially when working with large datasets.

   * Maximum Depth (max_depth): Limits the depth of the tree to prevent it 
    from growing too complex. This helps in reducing overfitting and 
    improves generalization.
   * Minimum Samples Split (min_samples_split): Ensures that a node must have 
    at least a certain number of samples before it can be split. 
    This prevents the model from creating overly specific branches that 
    may not generalize well.
   * Efficient Split Evaluation: The _best_split method is optimized 
    to handle only feasible splits by checking the minimum number of 
    samples required for a split.
